TCP Info Server
CS 494 - Assignment #2

Compile this program using accompanying Makefile.
Executable: echoserver

This program listens to port 11466 and accepts the following
case-sensitive commands:

VERSION
    Version number: ('1')
DAYTIME
    Current date/time in ctime format (RFC 2822)
RANDOM
    Random number 0-9
ECHO <string>
    Echos given <string>.

Using Bart Massey's existing TCP Echo server code, I modified the
echo server read in commands from client, then half-close the read
part of the socket of the connection. Then, the server parses the
command, replies with the appropriate response, and closes the
write part of the socket connection.
